# Income distributions in Canada

## Summary
This repostiory was developed to explore total personal income statistics provided by Statistics Canada.  The main result is a Dash application which can be found [here](add-path-to-app).

The income statistics are based on total personal income (line X of a Canadian income tax return) from the following tables:
- [Tax filers and dependants with income by total income, sex and age](https://doi.org/10.25318/1110000801-eng).
- [Income of individuals by age group, sex and income source, Canada, provinces and selected census metropolitan areas](https://doi.org/10.25318/1110023901-eng)

## A summary of Income Statistics in select Canada cities from 2016 is included below.
